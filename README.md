# XStorage

XStorage is a Valheim mod that lets you open multiple chests at once, rename them, and move items/stacks to the most suitable chest. 


# Download and installation instructions (for players)

XStorage is a [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) plugin. As such, you must have BepInEx installed.

XStorage makes use of the [Jötunn](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1138) library, so you must install that before installing XStorage. If you do not install Jötunn, XStorage will simply not be loaded by your game and it will not work.

1. Install [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1)
2. Click "Mod manager download" on XStorage's [Files](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2290?tab=files) page on Nexus Mods

# Installation instructions (for developers)

I will soon write a guide to get XStorage working in your development environment. For now, you can probably figure some stuff out by having a look at the [JötunnModStub](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub) project that XStorage is based on. Please bear in mind that the information there might have changed since XStorage was created, and that XStorage itself may over time have diverted from the steps laid out there. Again, a guide will follow soon!
