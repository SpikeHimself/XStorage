<#= mf.Heading("Installation instructions (for developers)") #>

I will soon write a guide to get <#= thisModName #> working in your development environment. For now, you can probably figure some stuff out by having a look at the [JotunnModStub](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub) project that <#= thisModName #> is based on. Please bear in mind that the information there might have changed since <#= thisModName #> was created, and that <#= thisModName #> itself may over time have diverted from the steps laid out there. Again, a guide will follow soon!
