# XStorage

XStorage lets you open multiple chests at once, rename them, and move items/stacks to the most suitable chest.

# Features

### Name your chests

By pressing alt-interact (`Shift + E` by default), you can give your chests a name. This name is shown when you hover over the chest, and also in the panel above the inventory when a chest is opened.

While XStorage is installed, chest names should show up everywhere your chests are mentioned, but if you uninstall XStorage, there will be no trace of that anymore. However, if you then install XStorage again, all those chest names will be back again, as they are permanently saved in your world file.

### Open many chests

To display multiple chests, XStorage creates a new panel in the UI. Sadly there aren't enough pixels on the screen to make everything fit nicely, so there is a small overlap with existing UI panels. Hopefully I can address this in the future.

In theory there is no limit to how many chests XStorage can display. When the UI panel is full, XStorage makes the panel scrollable. In a future version, I might impose a restriction on how many chests can be opened though, as this could cause performance issues.

Also on the roadmap are config options that let you configure the distance and methods that decide which chests are opened. One such method I have in mind is chest linking, i.e. every opened chests searches for other chests near it, so that you could open an entire row of chests from either end. For now, XStorage opens any chest that is within 5 meters of the player (again, with no maximum amount of chests).

### Moving items/stacks to the most suitable chest

When you auto-move an item from your inventory (by Ctrl+clicking it), XStorage tries to find the most suitable chest to put the item/stack in. It does so by picking the chest containing the highest quantity of the item you are moving, from all opened chests that still have free space.
So if you have a wooden chest with 499 stone in it, ctrl+clicking on a stack of stone in your inventory will move 1 stone to that chest. You have to then ctrl+click it again to make the rest go to the next most suitable chest.

Ctrl+clicking an item or stack in any of the chests will always make it go to the player inventory.

### Multiplayer

In multiplayer games, all players need to have XStorage installed, or it will not work. If you play on a dedicated server, the server also has to have XStorage installed.

### Known shortcomings

There are a few things that, at this stage, XStorage does not do well, or at all:

* **Gamepad input**: XStorage does not deal with gamepad input at all. That is to say, the UI kind of breaks when you use a gamepad. I will look into this in the future, but for now this mod is pretty much mouse/keyboard only.
* **The panel does not fit**: The XStorage UI panel does not fit within the vanilla UI very well. I am considering alternative ways of displaying the container panels (for example by overlapping or even removing the crafting panel. Does anyone even use that while opening a chest?)


# Installation instructions

Like most Valheim mods, XStorage is a [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) plugin. Make sure you have BepInEx installed.

XStorage makes use of the [JÃ¶tunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/) library, so don't forget to install that first. Without it, XStorage will not even load.

1. Install [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
2. Click "Install with Mod Manager"

# I did more too!

Please have a look at my other mod too! [XPortal](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/SpikeHimself/XPortal/) lets you select a portal destination from a list of existing portals, so that you don't have to match portal tags anymore.
